# ATMMachineDesign

## Introduction
Montana Savings Bank has recently been recommended the use of Automated Teller Machines to cut costs, eliminate errors, and provide a 24-hour service to its customers. The bank, and their consulting company have drafted a set of requirements they need to be programmed into their ATM. Our team was given was given the requirements and was told exactly what needed to be done but was also given some freedom to add features that would make the ATM better for the bank and for the customer. 
The Use case diagram and descriptions were the first operations to be done for the project. After carefully reading the requirements given to us by the bank, we drafted the Use cases, the Use case diagram, and the Use casesâ€™ dialogs. This eased our way into step two of the process where we were to analyze and design how our project will work. A presentation was given to the class describing the details of our specific project, and even a prototype User Interface was designed. During the presentation we presented our Processing Use Case that was created during our Requirements phase. For part three of the projected we completed all of the communication diagrams for all of our Use cases, the class diagrams, and the class descriptions. Finally, after analyzing and designing our project, classes could easily be implemented using the C++ programming language. Our Project was completed and delivered on 12/18/19. 

## Who are we?
Our Team contained two developers working side by side to complete the project. Jesus Toxtle and Kefin Sajan chose to work together to build the given project over the course of the semester. 
Every part of the project was carefully thought out and both members were on the same page before moving on. No conflicts did arise and working together went smoothly, and efficiently. The team developed most of the specifics of the design of the project together, and split the work that was done individually, equally. 
Overall no issues came up during the project. Some simple mistakes were easily fixed, and all projects were completed effectively and on time. Conflicting ideas were often settled easily as both members had similar ideas for the way things should work.
